# About Me 
I'm Lalith Sai Chakilam (a.k.a D3LET3-57), a passionate coder, gamer, and anime enthusiast. I love exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and sharing my knowledge with the community. Currently, I'm second year B.Tech student at IIT Roorkee. I am interested in Cybersecurity, AI/ML, and Low level stuff.
I play CTFs regularly with [InfoSecIITR](https://infoseciitr.in/).<br>
My favorite character is Zoro :)
