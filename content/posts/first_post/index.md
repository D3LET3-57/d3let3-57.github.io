# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my very first post!

I finally made a website. Took only 327 cups of coffee, 42 bug fixes, and a minor existential crisis.

Not much here yet, but stick around â€” things are about to get mildly interesting (hopefully).

Why did I make this site?  
Because yelling my thoughts into the void wasnâ€™t getting enough traction.

Stay tuned for more chaos, code, and probably more bad jokes.
