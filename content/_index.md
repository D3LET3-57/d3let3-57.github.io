Hi, I’m **D3LET3-57** — welcome to a space where I share notes, projects, and things I’m learning.  
This is a quiet place for deep dives, random thoughts, and technical experiments.

## About Me

  I write code in Python, C++, Assembly, and whatever else the project calls for.

- **AI Explorer**  
  I’m curious about language models, AI tools, and their unexpected uses.

  Notes and walkthroughs from challenges I’ve solved.
